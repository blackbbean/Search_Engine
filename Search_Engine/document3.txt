This book provides implementations of common and uncommon algorithms in
pseudocode which is language independent and provides for easy porting to most
imperative programming languages. It is not a definitive book on the theory of
data structures and algorithms.
For the most part this book presents implementations devised by the authors
themselves based on the concepts by which the respective algorithms are based
upon so it is more than possible that our implementations differ from those
considered the norm.
You should use this book alongside another on the same subject, but one
that contains formal proofs of the algorithms in question. In this book we use
the abstract big Oh notation to depict the run time complexity of algorithms
so that the book appeals to a larger audience.
