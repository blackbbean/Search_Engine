Big Oh notation also acts as a communication tool. Picture the scene: you
are having a meeting with some fellow developers within your product group.
You are discussing prototype algorithms for node discovery in massive networks.
Several minutes elapse after you and two others have discussed your respective
algorithms and how they work. Does this give you a good idea of how fast each
respective algorithm is? No. The result of such a discussion will tell you more
about the high level algorithm design rather than its efficiency. Replay the scene
back in your head, but this time as well as talking about algorithm design each
respective developer states the asymptotic run time of their algorithm. Using
the latter approach you not only get a good general idea about the algorithm
design, but also key efficiency data which allows you to make better choices
when it comes to selecting an algorithm fit for purpose.
