Most algorithms in this book require parameters, and because we assign no
explicit type to those parameters the type is inferred from the contexts in which
it is used, and the operations performed upon it. Additionally, the name of
the parameter usually acts as the biggest clue to its type. For instance n is a
pseudo-name for a number and so you can assume unless otherwise stated that
n translates to an integer that has the same number of bits as a WORD on a
32 bit machine, similarly l is a pseudo-name for a list where a list is a resizeable
array (e.g. a vector).
