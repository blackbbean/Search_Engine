The previous list represents what we believe in the vast majority of cases to
be the most important for each respective data structure.
For all readers we recommend that before looking at any algorithm you
quickly look at Appendix E which contains a table listing the various symbols
used within our algorithms and their meaning. One keyword that we would like
to point out here is yield. You can think of yield in the same light as return.
The return keyword causes the method to exit and returns control to the caller,
whereas yield returns each value to the caller. With yield control only returns
to the caller when all values to return to the caller have been exhausted.
