As you become more familiar with the actual problem you will be able to
intuitively identify areas which may cause problems for your algorithms implementation.
This in some cases will yield an overwhelming list of concerns which
will hinder your ability to design an algorithm greatly. When you are bombarded
with such a vast amount of concerns look at the overall problem again
and sub-divide the problem into smaller problems. Solving the smaller problems
and then composing them is a far easier task than clouding your mind with too
many little details.
