The example above describes an algorithm by the name of AlgorithmName,
which takes a single numeric parameter n. The pre and post conditions follow
the algorithm signature; you should always enforce the pre-conditions of an
algorithm when porting them to your language of choice.
Normally what is listed as a pre-conidition is critical to the algorithms operation.
This may cover things like the actual parameter not being null, or that the
collection passed in must contain at least n items. The post-condition mainly
describes the effect of the algorithms operation. An example of a post-condition
might be ¡°The list has been sorted in ascending order¡±
